# Introduction
When we measure the power of a car, this is always measured in horsepower. 
Those of us who prefer ducks would rather measure this in duck power.
Hence a method of conversion is required. 
This was calulated with use of Allen et al 2014, calculations as to the power that ducks innately have.
Moreover, a review of current measurements of horsepower by Bloggs et all in 2016, was utilised to 
standardise the calculations.
