Would conversion from horsepower to duck power really improve efficiency of fuel consumption? A model utilsation method.

# Introduction
When we measure the power of a car, this is always measured in horsepower. 
Those of us who prefer ducks would rather measure this in duck power.
Hence a method of conversion is required. 
This was calulated with use of Allen et al 2014, calculations as to the power that ducks innately have.
Moreover, a review of current measurements of horsepower by Bloggs et all in 2016, was utilised to 
standardise the calculations. 

# Simulations
John's model of the conversion between duck power and horsepower has predicted significant increase in efficiency in fuel consumption. 

# Methodology
The model was run using this software and was validated using a thing. Potato et all 2000

# Figures
This is where the figures go.

Thank you to all the people and ducks in my life. You have brought me much wisdom and guidance.
